# Bootstrap-Portfolio

<!-- I used  bootstrap to add more functionality to the webpage from first assignment. This was done most notably with the addition of a navbar and responsive images in the PORTFOLIO page.-->

<!-- In the PORTFOLIO page, I added responsive images in the style of thumbnails, all placed within cards. In the original non-bootstrap project, each project slot was a gallery element. -->

<!-- For the NAVBAR, I appreciated the fact that I didn't have to make a meticulous structure of nested divs like in the first project and could simply use the navbar class already embedded in bootstrap. i used the navbar-right command to get the menu elements to hang to the right -->

<!-- I used CSS primarily to add coloring to headers and styling to the footer. I tried to use it as little as possible. -->

<!-- I used the GRID SYSTEM for the content of each page, and nested a single column inside a single row inside another single column to add content. This made the content area look almost exactly like the original page, with bootstrap's default settings requiring minimal styling. -->
